#Firewall
Telnet is a very good tool to check if sockets are open with telnet IP PORT. For example, if you want to check if port 22 is open on web-02

##Requirements:

The requirements below must be applied to web-01 (feel free to do it on lb-01 and web-02, but it won’t be checked)
Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
22 (SSH)
443 (HTTPS SSL)
80 (HTTP)
Share the ufw commands that you used in your answer file

- Port forwarding
Firewalls can not only filter requests, they can also forward them.

Requirements:

Configure web-01 so that its firewall redirects port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP.
Your answer file should be a copy of the ufw configuration file that you modified to make this happen
